To use the .exe version please download the .7z file and extract it with 7 zip or WinRAR. !KEEP the .exe file in the folder it extracts to because it needs to be able to find the DLL files in the _internal folder! 
To use the python version make sure to downlaod python 3.12 and then pip install the packages: pygame, keyboard, and pywin32. With updates in the future you may need to isntall more packages. After this you are good to run the script!
