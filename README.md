To use the .exe version please download the .zip and extract it. KEEP the .exe file in the folder it extracts to because it needs to be able to find the DLL files in the _internal folder. 
To use the python version make sure to downlaod python 3.12 and then pip install the packages pygame, keyboard, and pywin32. After this you are good to run the script!
